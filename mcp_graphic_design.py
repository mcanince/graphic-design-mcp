**1. ALIGNMENT ISSUES:**
- Identify misaligned elements (text, images, buttons, etc.)
- Check for consistent margins and padding
- Evaluate baseline grid alignment
- Note any elements that break the layout structure

**2. SPACING PROBLEMS:**
- Analyze white space usage and distribution
- Check for inconsistent gaps between elements
- Identify cramped or overly spaced areas
- Evaluate breathing room around key elements

**3. SYMMETRY & ASYMMETRY:**
- Identify intentional vs unintentional asymmetric elements
- Check for visual balance issues
- Note elements that appear "off-center" when they shouldn't be
- Evaluate compositional balance

**4. GRID & STRUCTURE:**
- Assess adherence to grid system
- Identify elements that break the grid unnecessarily
- Check for consistent column widths and gutters
- Evaluate overall structural hierarchy

**5. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Provide exact pixel/spacing adjustments where possible
- Suggest alignment fixes for specific elements
- Recommend spacing improvements
- Propose solutions for asymmetry issues
- Give actionable layout optimization tips
